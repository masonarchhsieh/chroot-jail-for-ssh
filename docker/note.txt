This folder contains a Dockerfile and bash scripts(add_chroot_user and create_chrooted_jail) for creating a chroot jail.
The Dockerfile would build a docker image based on debian and copy the bash scripts to the /home/ directory.

To build the image:
    $ docker build -t debian-ssh-users .

It would automatically run the create_chrooted_jail.sh. You should be able to see the chroot/ under your /home/ directory.
You can then call the following command to add a new ssh user.
    $ bash add_chroot_user.sh
